# 🛠️ Java Workshop Repository

Welcome to the **Java Workshop Repository** — a curated collection of simple and practical Java programs designed to reinforce foundational programming concepts. Each program targets a specific real-world scenario to help you develop hands-on coding experience.

## 📂 Programs Included

### ✈️ Flight Booking System
**Scenario**: Simulates a basic flight booking system.  
**Key Features**:
- Stores flight data using an array.
- Accepts bookings and stores them in a list.
- Allows case-insensitive flight search using string operations.
- Includes methods to search, book, and view bookings.

### 🧠 Online Quiz Platform – Result Processor
**Scenario**: Processes user-submitted answers on a quiz platform and evaluates the result.  
**Key Features**:
- Uses `String[]` for storing correct and user answers.
- Compares answers, calculates total scores, and assigns grades.
- Handles mismatched input lengths by throwing a custom `InvalidQuizSubmissionException`.
- Stores scores of multiple users in a `List<Integer>`.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🧰 Requirements
- Java JDK 8 or above
- Any text editor or IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VS Code)
- Terminal/command line to compile and run Java files

### ▶️ How to Run
1. **Compile a program:**
   ```bash
   javac FileName.java


2. **Run the compiled program:**

   ```bash
   java FileName
   ```

Replace `FileName` with the actual Java file you want to execute, such as `SimpleFlightBooking` or `QuizResultProcessor`.

## 📌 Learning Goals

* Practice with arrays and collections (`List`)
* Understand modular coding through methods
* Learn exception handling using custom exceptions
* Improve string handling and console I/O operations
* Simulate real-life logic in Java

## 🚧 Coming Soon

More Java programs will be added to this repository regularly, covering topics like:

* Student record management
* File I/O operations
* Mini games
* Sorting and searching algorithms
* And much more...

Stay tuned!
